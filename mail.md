## Transfer mail to Gmail via IMAP

Gmail does not support import via IMAP so it's really hard to transfer all your mail to Gmail. Especially if you want to preserve your folder structure.

But assuming you have 10â€“15 folders there is a workaround:

Go to your existing mail settings and enable POP access for a SINGLE folder. It's recommended to mark all messages unread and enable "Mark as read" option for POP so you can check which ones are already imported.
Then go to Gmail settings and start import via POP to the label with the same name and with archive option enabled.
Wait while import is finished.
Repeat steps 1-3 for each folder you have.
